"**Tell-me a Trail**" is a mobile application that provides an improved tailored experience to walkers and hikers through interactive multimedia narratives. It is integrated in a Web architecture supported by [OGC standard](https://www.ogc.org/publications/) services. The mobile app addresses accessibility challenges, ensuring detailed information was provided on terrain types, trail difficulty, specific equipments, and sections for accessible hiking.

## Case Study

The application has been extansively tested by users with various profiles, with different trails in Portugal

But a main case study has been identified and will be used for further development of the app. It is located in the region of [Serra da Estrela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_da_Estrela), Portugal.

A trail called "**Verdelhos and Beijames river**" has been chosen to illustrate different types of narratives around this trail, built around topics such as:

- Geology (The trail is integrated in the [Serra da Estrela GeoPark](https://www.geoparkestrela.pt/) ), 
- Wild Fires ([The area has been battered with wild fires in the recent years](https://youtu.be/R9bYle4VxaI?si=7IULjzuriweiKSP6)), 
- Fauna and flora (the mountain biotope is unique in Portugal), 
- Local Economy and activities.

[Verdelhos wasteland is also the forest that feeds a community](https://www.publico.pt/2024/08/11/azul/noticia/portugal-baldio-verdelhos-floresta-alimenta-comunidade-2100313) (limited access).

> Input data, trails tracks and images were acquired by the authors and are available as open data.
