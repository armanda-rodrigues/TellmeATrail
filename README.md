## Case Study

The application has been tested by user with various profiles, with different trails in Portugal

But a main case study has been identified and will be used in further development of the app. It is located in the region of [Serra da Estrela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_da_Estrela), Portugal.

A trail called "**Verdelhos and Beijames river**" has been chosen to illustrate different types of narratives built around topics such as:

- Geology (The trail is integrated in the [Serra da Estrela GeoPark](https://www.geoparkestrela.pt/) ), 
- Wild Fires (The area has been battered with wild fires in the recent years), 
- Fauna and flora (the mountain biotope is unique in Portugal), 
- Local Economy and activities.

[Verdelhos wasteland is also the forest that feeds a community](https://www.publico.pt/2024/08/11/azul/noticia/portugal-baldio-verdelhos-floresta-alimenta-comunidade-2100313) (limited access).

> Input data, trails tracks and images were acquired by the authors and are available as open data.
